Highlights
Application flow
main.tsx (Entry)  ↓App.tsx (Root)  ↓Providers (Auth, Cart, Favorites)  ↓Router  ↓Routes → Pages  ↓Components → UI
File organization
pages/ = Routes (what user sees)
components/ = Reusable UI pieces
lib/ = Business logic & utilities
data/ = Static/mock data
How files connect
React Context — global state (auth, cart, favorites)
React Router — navigation between pages
Props — parent to child communication
API calls — backend integration via lib/api.ts
Hooks — useAuth(), useCart(), useNavigate(), etc.
Data flow
User Action  ↓Component Event  ↓Context Update OR API Call  ↓State Change  ↓UI Re-render
Key insights
Single entry point: main.tsx → App.tsx
Context providers: nested (ErrorBoundary → Auth → Cart → Favorites)
Routing: all routes defined in App.tsx
API: centralized in lib/api.ts with automatic JWT injection
State: Context API for global state, useState for local state
Persistence: localStorage for token, user, cart, favorites
